RPGAlertView
============

A UIAlertView subclass with the aim of eradicating displaying of multiple UIAlertViews of the same kind. Usage remains the same as any other UIAlertView but just use the RPGAlertView subclass of it.

Usage:

Just #import "RPGAlertView.h" and instantiate an instance of RPGAlertView instead of UIAlertView. Use this new object just like how you use UIAlertView, everything happens behind the scene.
